# Mystery-Word
A python program that creates hangman style word game.

# To Run:
In terminal enter python mystery_word.py.

The game prompts the player for a easy (4-6 letter words), medium (6-8 letter words), or hard difficulty (8+ letter words).
The user is then allowed to guess a letter at a time. If correct, the letter will appear in its place/s in the word. If 
incorrect it will take an 'incorrect guess' away from the user. The user starts with 8 incorrect guesses. The word is displayed
if the user runs out of guesses.
